Before rolling, both you and your opponent must announce the number of dice you intend to roll. * You, the attacker, will roll 1,2 or 3 dice: You must have at least one more army in your territory than the number of dice you roll. * The defender will roll either 1 or 2 white dice: To roll 2 dice, he or she must have at least 2 armies on the territory under attack."

In case of a tie, the defender always wins. The attacker can never lose more than 2 armies on a single roll."
